# Luftdaten-to-CSV
A simple script taking selected data from sensordata JSON and writing in a csv locally.
You can find your JSON URL on http://data.sensor.community/airrohr/v1/sensor/28520/ where 28520 is the sensorID
It takes the values and time and writes in a csv locally
I have automised with CRON on linux (my old laptop running as server on my home network)
